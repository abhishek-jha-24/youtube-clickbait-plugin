# youtube-clickbait-plugin
The extension displays every video with a rating provided by our api(created at https://github.com/abhishek-jha-24/youtube-clickbait-plugin/tree/main/anan). The api uses A sentiment analysis based approach on YouTube comments to detect the fairness of the video and to label it as click bait or non-click bait and also provides a video comment rating.

Advantages:

Users can get the rating without clicking on video which saves their time 
+ as they no more have to see the annoying double adds at the very start without even knowing the fairness of that video.
+ Views would be of more priorty as irrelevant views would be less.
+ less chance of users getting scammed as they will be alerted if the video was found to be a click-bait one.
